Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) database running locally or accessible.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    cd SerenityEWS
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Fill in your details as shown below.

    ```dotenv
    # Google AI API Key for Genkit
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY

    # PostgreSQL Database Connection
    DB_USER=postgres
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_DATABASE=serenityews
    DB_PASSWORD=postgres
    DB_PORT=5432
    ```
    *Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` with your actual key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).*

4.  **Set up the database:**
    -   Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running.
    -   Create a new database named `serenityews`.
    -   Connect to your new database and run the SQL commands in `schema.sql` to create the necessary `reports` table.
    
    Example using `psql`:
    ```bash
    psql -U postgres -d serenityews -a -f schema.sql
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  **(Optional) Run the Genkit Developer UI:**
    To inspect and test your AI flows separately, run the Genkit development UI in a separate terminal. It will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
